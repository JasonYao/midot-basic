By [Jason Yao](https://github.com/JasonYao)

## Description
This is a set of basic dotfiles built using
[midot](https://github.com/JasonYao/midot)'s
api, and is in compliance with `midot`'s
interface.

This repo's primary purpose is to showcase
how you can quickly build your own set of
dotfiles, both from using `midot`'s API,
and by conforming to `midot`'s interface.

## Overview

## Notes
In this repo, we highlight using

better.
